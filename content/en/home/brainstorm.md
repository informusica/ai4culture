We would like to invite you to share your ideas on what AI can mean for the culture and media sectors. For this, we will use the online dotstorming tool, in which you can contribute new ideas, comment on exiting ideas, and vote on ideas you like.

You can do this for three questions:
* [What generally comes to your mind, when hearing the term 'AI'?](https://dotstorming.com/b/5fbbce165669c54ea983a623)
* [What kind of patterns would you like to extract or discover, in or surrounding your practice?](https://dotstorming.com/b/5fbbd2185669c54ea983a642)
* [Who and/or what would you need, in order to concretely be able to adopt AI in your practice?](https://dotstorming.com/b/5fbbd2b05669c54ea983a64a)
